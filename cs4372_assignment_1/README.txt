-----Part 1-----
1) Run part1.py to run the Gradient Descent algorithm with the MOMENTUM optimizer on the Automobile dataset received from GitHub.
 **** If .py files do not run, please go to the .ipynb files.
2) Open "logs and trials" folder to see all the logs and trials.
3) Open "part_1" to view the logs and trials for part 1.
4) "log_trial_1 / mse_trial_1" is the first trial and gradually, it increments until the "final_log / final_mse"
5) Open "predictions.csv" to see the y_predictions made by gradient descent.

-----Part 2-----
1) Open part2.py to run the Linear Regression algorithm on the Automobile dataset received by GitHub.
2) The library we used was SKLEARN and the model we used was LinearRegression
3) Open "logs and trials" folder to see all the logs and trials.
4) Open "part_2" to view the predictions for part 2.
